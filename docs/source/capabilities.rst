Capabilities of Prefactor
=========================

Prefactor derives and corrects for direction-independent effects in LOFAR data,
including clock offsets and bandpass. The output data are suitable 
for processing further with direction-dependent calibration.


Prefactor was designed to work on compute clusters and allows for the
distribution of jobs over multiple nodes of a cluster.
